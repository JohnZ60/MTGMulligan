# MTGMulligan
Hello, This is a project for the UTSA Fall 2020 AI class.

The focus of this project is to allow other MTG programmers to test their decks with the Mulligan feature of the game. 
Optimizing a mulligan is the first step to successful and more competitive gameplay.  

Given the countless possibilities of the deckbuilding and gameplay aspects, optimizing a hand in a game match up may prove challenging, so there are some rules we use to allow the AI to function better:
A hand must have at least 2 lands, 2 spells it can play early on and will allow 2 mulligans.  Mulliganning past 2 times creates some very low winrates due to the massive card disadvantage.
